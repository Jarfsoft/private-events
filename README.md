# Ruby on Rails Private Events

> Welcome to our **Ruby on Rails Private-Events** project built mainly with `Ruby` and `Ruby on Rails`. The main purpose of this app is to practice *associations* in `Ruby on Rails`.
Users can create and attend events only if they are logged in but they can only edit or delete their own profile.
